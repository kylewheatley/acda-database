						<h2>Creation and Maintenance of Database</h2>
						<p>The database was created as part of my graduate research ours at the University of Alabama.
						Little did I know that later it would be published as part of a greater historical document celebrating the 60 year history of the <a href="https://acda.org/">American Choral Directors Association (ACDA).</a></p>
						<h2>Information about the Organization and Convention</h2>
						<p>The American Choral Directors Association is the largest international organization of choral directors in the world.
						Their history spans over sixty years and began as a meeting of 35 choral directors wanting to create an organization for only choral music.
						The first membership charter had 111 members and now has tens of thousands of members. As the organization grew, it was divided into 7 regional divisions across the United States.
						They host yearly conventions to showcase outsanding choral performances and learn from other oustanding conductors.
						Years ending in an even number, conventions are hosted by each respective division.
						Years ending in an odd number are National Convention years, hosted throughout the United States.
						Choral directors from around the world submit recordings of their choir in hopes of being selected at this prestigious convention that is attended by thousands of directors.</p>

						<h2>Data Gathering and Authenticty</h2>
						<p>Remnants of an original database were give to me from my cooperating professor. He instructed me to double check the accuracy and to get it up to date.
						The original file only had 8 of the conventions entered and there were many empty places. Luckily, ACDA has digitized all of their monthly publication <i>The Choral Journal</i>, so I had access to the primary source in which the choirs and their conductors.
						Not only was this data published in the monthly journal, it was also published in the convention program for attendees.
						Many of these documents were not digitized so I had to spend time in the archives at the ACDA headquarters to have access to the documents.
						The original purpose of our research was just to some basic calculations for what would evenually be a chapter in a book on the history of ACDA.
						Additional data areas were added for the purpose of our research:
						<ul>
							<li>Approximately how far did the choir travel to the convention?</li>
							<li>Is the choir representing a Historically Black College or Univeristy (HBCU)?</li>
							<li>Is the choir a member of the Gay and Lesbian Association of Choruses (GALA)?</li>
							<li>What type of choir is it?</li>
						</ul>
						These datapoints were added to possibly use for later publication.
						To calculate the milage a simple GoogleMaps search was done (ex. Fort Wort, TX to Chicago, IL for a choir that was based in Fort Worth and a convention host city in Chicago).
						Distance travelled calculations were not done for international choirs and also for honor choirs. Additionally, if a choir's location and the convention host city were identical, a 0 was used for mileage.
						There are is a list of HBCUs published by the U.S. Department of Education and GALA choruses are listed on their <a href="https://galachoruses.org/membership/member-directory/">website.</a>
						To address the types of choir some assumptions had to be made based on the title of the group and if it was still questioned, reserach was done to make the best determination.
						There was a possibility many different types of choirs but to better compartmentalize the defintions for our reasearch the following types were used:
						<ol>
							<li>Children/Elementary</li>
							<li>Church</li>
							<li>College</li>
							<li>Community</li>
							<li>High School</li>
							<li>Honor</li>
							<li>International</li>
							<li>Middle School</li>
						</ol>
						All of these are pretty well defined except <i>Community</i> because in many circles, a community choir is a choir that does not compensate singers for their performances and professional choirs like to distinguish themselves accordingly.
						To determine whether an organization compensates its singers or not is very tough to determine due to the fact that many organizations do not like to publizise this information.
						Conductor(s) names and genders and ACDA divions each choir are in were added as well.
						<center><h4><b><i>The resulting database has 1228 choirs, 21 fields of information, and is updated continually </i></b></h4></center></p>
						<h2>Analysis</h2>
						<p>I began looking at overall convention data and trying to focus on speicfic groups that have been underrepresented or overrepresented.
						Starting off I just wanted to show the trend of the number of choirs being invited to perform at the conventions and the breakdown of the types of choirs being invited.

						There has been a steady increase of choirs invited to perform. The only outliers are the 2005 and 2021 conventions.
						The 2005 convention was held in New York City and I believe the number of choirs was increased to celebrat the 45th anniversary of the organization that would have happend the previous year but did not because it was a divisional convention year.
						The 2021 Convention was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The convention was to be held in Dallas, TX and all data was entered as if it were to actually have happened.
						All choirs were notified as if the convention was going to happen but then it had to be moved to a virtual format. Choirs made recordings of what would have been their concert performance. The performances were very diverse in nature because very state and community had their own mandates to follow; some were all together and in masks, some were all on separate video screens, some had to add recordings from other years to suppliment their alloted time due for one reason or another. </p>
						Next, I need to collect a breakdown of the number of choirs in each different type that have performed and also see if there is any bias towards any particular country for international performances.

						The last set of analysis I observed was the distance travelled by two underrepresented groups - GALA and HBCU choruses. I used an average milage because some GALA and HBCU choruses have actually performed more than once
						<class="image"><img src="images/Avg Distance (GALA_HBCU).png" alt=""/>
						<h2>Conclusions</h2>
						As noted earlier the number of choirs performing each convention is growing larger; however, the number of GALA and HBCU choruses are not increasing. 
						Additionally, 4 of the 7 HBCUs that have performed have had to travel further than the average non-HBCU performing choir. GALA choruses actually do not typically have to travel very far to get to the convention, except for one choir who had to travel over twice the average of other choirs.
						The types of choirs performing is another area of need. College, Community, and High School choirs make up 72% of the total number of choirs performing - the next closest total are International choirs almost half of the number of choirs who have performed than the smallest of the aforementioned three types.
						<center><h3><i><b>Why does this matter? Money and Access</b></i></h3></center>
						These are expensive to take on. From the price of travelling by bus or airfare, hotels, food, uniforms, price of music performed at the convention, entrance fee, application fee, recording fee for the initial submission, any additional special music like a piece specially commissioned for the performance, just to name a few - THIS IS VERY EXPENSIVE.
						Sadly, not all communities can support this type of endeavor and therefore many choirs that probably should be performing at these types of conventions, simply cannot because they do not have access to the funds as others do.
						ACDA has taken steps to increase representation at their National Conventions but I fear it may be too little, too late because the organization has suffered greatly financially due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
